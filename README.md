ILOVEYOU, sometimes referred to as Love Bug or Love Letter, was a computer worm that attacked tens of millions of Windows personal computers on and after 5 May 2000 local time in the Philippines when it started spreading as an email message with the subject line "ILOVEYOU" and the attachment "LOVE-LETTER-FOR-YOU.txt.vbs".

# How it works 

The worm is distributed primarily through email, most prominently Microsoft Outlook at the time. It does so by sending an email to each of the victim's contacts, listed in their Address Book.

When executed, it infects different files in the system by writing itself to document files, MP3s/MP2s, JPEG, and other Visual Basic scripts and changing their extension to .vbs, making them executable.

It also makes it so, after having executed the script the first time, will execute on each startup of the computer, making it very difficult to stop.

It relies on the fact that Windows will automatically execute any Visual Basic Script files, when opened from the file explorer or from Outlook, making it trivial for a victim to accidentally execute it.
